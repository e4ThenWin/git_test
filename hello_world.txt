"Hello World" was one of the first messages outputed by a computer.
I don't remember all of the history behind it but, but it is customary
to print this string to the terminal when you first start coding. I 
also like to do it when debugging, but I imagine that practice will 
soon be behind me once I learn how to debug better.
